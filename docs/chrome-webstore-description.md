DealWise - Rental Investment Analyzer

A Personal Note from the Developer

As an emerging real estate investor, I developed DealWise to address the limitations I encountered with existing analysis tools. While numerous rental property calculators are available, most require paid subscriptions, redirect users to external platforms, or necessitate manual data entry into separate calculators. I sought a solution that operates entirely within the browser, provides immediate insights, remains completely free, and offers the flexibility to adapt to individual investment strategies.

Having found this tool invaluable for my own investment analysis, I decided to share it with the broader real estate community. DealWise is entirely free, processes all data locally within your browser to ensure privacy, and provides comprehensive features for thorough property evaluation.

I'm releasing this publicly in the hope that other investors will find it equally beneficial. If you find it helpful or have suggestions for improvements, I welcome your feedback at dealwise.contact@gmail.com.
