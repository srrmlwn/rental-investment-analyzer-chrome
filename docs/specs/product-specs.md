## MVP Scope

- Focuses on cash flow analysis
- Uses a fixed sidebar interface
- Stateless operation (no property saving/comparison)
- Supports basic configuration with defaults

## User Experience Flow
1. User navigates to a Zillow listing page
2. Plugin sidebar automatically appears on the right
3. Plugin extracts property data and performs initial analysis
4. User can:
   - View cash flow analysis
   - Adjust configuration parameters
   - Save their preferred defaults

## Technical Requirements

### Implementation Approach
We will implement this as a standalone Chrome extension for the following reasons:
- Professional user experience without requiring additional software
- Direct distribution through Chrome Web Store
- Better security and permissions management
- More reliable DOM manipulation and styling
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Better performance as a native extension

### Data Extraction
- Parse Zillow listing page HTML for property details
- Extract Zestimate data when available
- Fallback to HUD data API for rental estimates
- Handle missing data gracefully

### Performance
- Low latency data extraction and analysis
- Minimal impact on page load time
- Efficient DOM manipulation for sidebar

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome browser only (MVP)
- Support for latest Chrome version
- Implemented as a native Chrome extension

## Configuration Management
1. **Per-Property Configuration**
   - Users can adjust values for individual property analysis
   - Changes are temporary and only apply to current property
   - Reset button to restore default values

2. **Default Configuration**
   - "Save as Default Settings" checkbox in configuration panel
   - When checked, current values become new defaults
   - Stored in Chrome's extension storage
   - Persists across browser sessions
   - Can be reset to factory defaults

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
1. Additional metrics:
   - Cap Rate
   - Cash-on-Cash Return
   - Net Rental Return (NRR)
2. Support for Zillow search page
3. Property comparison features
4. Export functionality
5. Support for other real estate websites

## Success Metrics
1. Accurate cash flow calculations
2. Fast sidebar load time (< 1 second)
3. Reliable data extraction
4. User-friendly error messages
5. Smooth configuration experience
