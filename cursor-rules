  - `product-specs.md`
  - `idea.md`
  - `task-breakdown.md`  # Added task breakdown to priority files

  - `src/constants/selectors.js`
  - `src/services/dataExtractor.js`
  - Any file in `src/content/`, `src/background/`, `src/services/`, `src/utils/`, and `src/constants/`

## 3. Task Management
- Always update `task-breakdown.md` when:
  - Starting a new feature
  - Completing a task
  - Identifying new requirements
  - Changing task priorities
  - Adding dependencies
- Task breakdown format:
  - Use clear, hierarchical structure
  - Include status, priority, and dependencies
  - Break down complex tasks into subtasks
  - Mark completed items with [x]
  - Keep future tasks section updated
- When implementing features:
  1. Check task-breakdown.md for existing tasks
  2. Update task status as work progresses
  3. Add new subtasks as they are identified
  4. Document any blockers or dependencies
